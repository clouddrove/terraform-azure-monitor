We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-monitor/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:

```hcl
module "key_vault" {
  source                      = "clouddrove/monitor/azure"
  name                        = "app"
  environment                 = "test"
  label_order                 = ["name", "environment"]
  resource_group_name         = module.resource_group.resource_group_name
  location                    = module.resource_group.resource_group_location
  linked_resource_ids         = [module.log-analytics.workspace_id]
  subnet_id                   = module.subnet.default_subnet_id[0]
  private_dns_zones_names = [
    "privatelink.agentsvc.azure-automation.net",
    "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net",
    "privatelink.monitor.azure.com",
    "privatelink.ods.opinsights.azure.com",
    "privatelink.oms.opinsights.azure.com",
  ]
 }
  ```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| alias\_sub | Different subscription id for local provider(id of diff sub in which DNS zone is present). | `string` | `null` | no |
| ampls\_enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating ampls resource. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| azurerm\_monitor\_private\_link\_scope\_id | The id  of the monitor private link scope from which private dns will be created for it | `string` | `null` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| diff\_sub | Flag to tell whether dns zone is in different sub or not. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| diff\_sub\_location | Location where different subscription resource should be created. | `string` | `""` | no |
| diff\_sub\_resource\_group\_name | A container that holds related different subscription resources for an Azure solution | `string` | `""` | no |
| enable\_private\_endpoint | enable or disable private endpoint to storage account | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| linked\_resource\_ids | (Required) The name of the Azure Monitor Private Link Scoped Service. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br>  ""<br>]</pre> | no |
| location | Location where resource should be created. | `string` | `""` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| private\_dns\_zones\_names | The name of the private dns zones from which private dns will be created for AMPLS | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br>  ""<br>]</pre> | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-azure-subnet.git"` | no |
| resource\_group\_name | A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution | `string` | `""` | no |
| subnet\_id | (Required) The ID of the Subnet from which Private IP Addresses will be allocated for this Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | `string` | `""` | no |
| subscription\_id | (Optional) Specifies the ID of the subscription. If this argument is omitted, the subscription ID of the current Azure Resource Manager provider is used. | `string` | `""` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |

## Outputs

No output.




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
